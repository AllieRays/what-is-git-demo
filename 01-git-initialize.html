Step One: First you must download git.

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Step Two: Tell git who you are.

$ git config --global user.name "Rick Sanchez"
$ git config --global user.email RickSanchez@plumbus.com

Step Three: cd into a project directory and type the following command to create a new git repo

$ git init

Step Four: Add a new file for this exercise we added 01-git-initialize.html. Use git status to see what changes have been made to the repo.

$ git status

Step Five: Add the new file to the git repository. We are going to use Git add [file-name] to make sure we are only adding the file we want to the repository.

$ git add 01-git-initialize.html

Step Six: Create a commit message to tell the git repo of your changes. Best practices is to add a jira ticket number with this commit, but since there is not jira project with this demo we will just add a commit message.

$ git commit -m"Adding 01-git-initialize.html to the repo"

Step Seven: Add git repo to remote repository and push your code up to the remote.

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/[your_github_username]/what-is-git-demo.git
$ git push -u origin master
